# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
Bobby's manager has given us two more assignments: the first is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, after that we need to write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
## Results
From the findings of the eligible retirees, high percentage of the workforce, we can know that:
- There are total of 32,452 staffs
- There are total of 29,415 senior engineers and 14,221 engineers
- There are 8,047 senior staffs
- There are 4,502 technique leaders
- There are 1,761 assistant engineers
## Summary
- How many roles will needto be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 90,398 roles are in urgent need to be filled out as soon as the workforce starts retiring at any given time.
